The following is an example .ini file for the new, CLASSv2.9 phenomenological EDE code.
I have added descriptions of each input character.
Input characters originally in CLASS are not redescribed here.

--- New EDE params ---

!!!!!! this param must be turned to yes.
I don't remember it in CLASSv2.7, but it's not a param I added.
So not technically a new EDE param, but needs to be added for EDE to function.
Default is no

do_shooting = yes

Switch for the fluid equation of state. Options are
- 'CPL', the original fluid in CLASS, (default) and
- 'EDE', which base CLASS has as a tracker model.
	Our EDE is added under this flag also.

fluid_equation_of_state = EDE

Switch for EDE parametrization, pretty obvious. Options are
- 'tracker' for tracker EDE models. Their coding in CLASS is currently incomplete. Don't use! (default)
- 'pheno_axion' for our EDE based on 1806.10608 && 1811.04083
- 'pheno_ADE' for the EDE model from 1905.12618

ede_parametrization = pheno_axion


Parameter controlling the width of the EDE transition. Larger is wider transition time. Default 1
nu_fld = 1

Upper limit of n pheno axion above which code assumes n pheno axion is infinity. Default 500
n_cap_infinity = 100

N such that final eq of state of EDE is w = n-1 / n+1. Default inf (1000)
#n_pheno_axion = 50

Final eq of state of the EDE. You cannot specify both n pheno axion and w final, the code is set up to complain. Default 1
w_fld_f = 0.8

Non adiabatic sound speed of the fliud. Code currently set up to keep this constant. Default 1
#cs2_fld = 0.8

For the ADE model, are the non-ad sound speed and final eq of state equal? Default no (this parameter is ignored for other models)
cs2_is_wn = yes

For the pheno axion model, one has to specify Theta_initial_fld to compute the scale dependent cs2; (this parameter is ignored for other models)
Theta_initial_fld = 1

Critical redshift of EDE. Default 1. Can be provided as either a_c or log_10(a_c), through the .ini and for runs.
#a_c = 1e-4
log10_a_c =  -3.6

Should the code shoot for a_c by matching a_peak to a_eq?
If this is set, the code will complain if you also try to input a_c.
NOTE!! This requires a number input. Default is a_c

# a_peak_eq = 1e-4

Number of ways to input EDE energy density.
- Omega_fld and omega_fld refer to energy density today.
- Omega_fld_ac refers to energy density at a_c but relative to critical density today.
- fraction_fld_ac is the fractional energy density in EDE at a_c. This is what we usually run with.
The code will complain if multiple of these are input.
Default is Omega_fld = 0

#omega_fld = 0.01
#Omega_fld = 0.01
#Omega_fld_ac = 0.01
fraction_fld_ac =0.1154683

EDE pehno_axion needs PPF to be turned off and use_big_theta_fld to be turned on.
use_ppf = no
use_big_theta_fld = no
use_delta_fld_over_1plusw = no
